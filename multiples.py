# In the `multiples.py` file, let's write the following code:

# 1. Print out the multiples of 3
for count in range(100):
    if count % 3 == 0:
        print(count)
# 2. Now using the same loop, letâ€™s see if we can print out the multiples of 5 too
    elif count % 5 == 0:
        print(count)

        # if count % 3 or count % 5 == 0
        # print(count)
